    "- The model doesn't \"read\" text like humans do. Instead, a tokenizer breaks down the input into these tokens and converts them into numerical IDs the model can understand.\n",
    "- The model then learns patterns and relationships between these tokens to predict the next one in a sequence, this is how it generates coherent responses.\n",
    "- A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. This translates to roughly ¾ of a word (so 100 tokens ~= 75 words)."
